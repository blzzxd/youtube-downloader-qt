## About
I created this program for me to fastly download videos from youtube without searching weird downloader sites.

### Platform
Windows.

### Downloaded video directory
By default downloaded videos stores in `C:/downloaded-videos/`. Of course you can change it in `main.py` file. `video_path = '<your path>'`

## Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/blzzxd/youtube-downloader-qt
```

## Used libraries
This program using only 2 libraries. `pyqt6` and `pytube` and some built-in libraries

## Build
You can convert main.py file to an exe file with `auto-py-to-exe` library. Don't forget to copy `youtubedownloader.ui` file to your exe file location.
